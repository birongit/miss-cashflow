            <h2>How to Screen a Rental Property in less than 5 Minutes</h2>
            <h3>1. Intro - The Deal Funnel</h3>
            <p>
                As a real estate investor, you‚Äôll see hundreds of deals. Most will be bad. Some will be good. A few will
                be great. The key is to quickly filter out the bad ones so you can focus on the great deals.
            </p>
            <p>
                But how?
                You need a system - a way to quickly assess the deal‚Äôs potential without getting bogged down in details.
            </p>
            <p>
                That‚Äôs where this tool comes in. It‚Äôs designed to help you quickly analyze a rental property in under 5
                minutes. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs fast. And speed is what you need when you‚Äôre looking at many deals
                at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                <em>Note:</em> This tool assumes you have your deal flow set up - you have leads coming in, from the
                MLS, from your agent, from wholesalers, etc.
                If you don't have that set up, start there and check out my post <a href="../blog.html"></a> on how to
                turn your inbox into a deal flow machine.
            </p>
            <h3>2. The Strategy - Why Cash Flow Is Important for Buy-and-Hold Rentals</h3>
            <p>
                This tool is based on one assumption: you're looking for a buy-and-hold rental that generates positive
                cash flow from day one. That means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It brings in more than it costs each month</li>
                <li>It isn‚Äôt a speculative play based on appreciation</li>
                <li>It works for long-term or mid-term strategies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Cash flow isn‚Äôt everything, but it‚Äôs your first line of defense ‚Äî especially when you're starting out.
                It cushions your mistakes, gives you room to grow, and helps you hold through market cycles.</p>

            <p>The goal here isn‚Äôt perfection - it‚Äôs speed. You want to ask, ‚ÄúIs this deal worth my time?‚Äù
                ‚Äî and get your answer in under 5 minutes.</p>
            <h3>3. The Tool - How to Use It</h3>
            <p>You can manually run these quick checks on your deals - Or you can use <a href="../tools.html">my Notion
                    tool</a> for free. All you need to do is duplicate the template and plug in some very basic data:
            </p>
            <ul id="property-details">
                <li><em>Address: </em>Location of the property</li>
                <li><em>Purchase price: </em>What you expect or are willing to pay. This can deviate from
                    the asking price.</li>
                <li><em>Monthly rent: </em>The expected rent once you stabilize the property. If the property
                    is currently occupied, will you be able and allowed to adjust the rent? Use resources such as
                    rentometer.com, zillow.com, or ask your agent or property manager.</li>
                <li><em>Neighborhood rating: </em>Use the A+ to C- scale to reflect the quality of the neighborhood,
                    based on income levels, crime rates, tenant profiles, and general livability.
                    <ul>
                        <li>A = high-income, low-crime, mostly owner-occupied, and tend to attract reliable tenants ‚Äî
                            lower
                            cash flow, but lower risk.</li>
                        <li>B = middle-income, moderate crime</li>
                        <li>C = lower-income, higher-crime, high turnover ‚Äî can produce stronger cash flow, but often
                            come
                            with more management headaches.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The tool will then:
            <ol>
                <li>Calculate the <em>rent-to-price ratio</em>. A ratio of 1% signals
                    a good chance to generate positive cash flow (‚Üí 1%-rule).</li>
                <li>Give you a <em>quick verdict</em> (Consider / Maybe /
                    Reject) based on rent-to-price ratio and neighborhood grade</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                The genral decision logic is encoded in the Notion formula, but you can adjust it to your own local
                market and preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, you can manually override the auto-verdict with the simple dropdown menu. You might know
                something the numbers don‚Äôt. For example, is there potential for value-add? Zoning laws that need to be
                considered? A huge lot that comes with the proeprty? Use the override field to change the verdict.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Example - A Duplex</h3>
            <p>
                Let‚Äôs take 123 Main Street, a duplex in a B-rated neighborhood. The asking price is $300,000, and you
                expect to rent each unit for $1,100 per month after stabilization. You don't expect much negotiation on
                the price, so you enter:</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Purchase Price</th>
                        <td>$300,000</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Monthly Rent</th>
                        <td>$2,200</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Neighborhood</th>
                        <td>B</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            You receive a Rent-to-Price Ratio of 0.73%, which is far below the 1% rule. Despite the decent neighborhood
            it will suggest to skip this deal. However, you know that the property comes with a huge lot that you could
            potentially split or use for additional development. You decide to override the verdict to "Consider"
            because of the potential.</p>
            <h3>5. Next Steps</h3>
            <p>Once you filtered out a few deals that are worth a closer look, you decide which investing strategy you
                want to pursue and start the deal analysis.</p>

            <p>Skip hours of spreadsheet work ‚Äî start screening deals in minutes.</p>
